The program must accept the durations of N videos. A duration contains two
integers HH representing the hours and MM representing the minutes separated by a colon. The
program must print the total hours and the total minutes for N videos as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= HH <= 23
0 <= MM <= 59
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains the duration of N videos each separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the total hours and the total minutes for N videos separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
03:26 02:38 01:05 22:59
Output:
30 8
Explanation:
Total hours = 28 (3 + 2 + 1 + 22).
Total minutes = 128 (26 + 38 + 5 + 59). 128 minutes is nothing but 2 hours and 8 minutes.
So the total hours is 30 (28 + 2) and the total minutes is 8.
Hence the output is 30 8
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2
23:05 23:55
Output:
47 0





Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int h=0,m=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        int x,y;
        scanf("%d:%d ",&x,&y);
        h+=x;
        m+=y;
    }
    int i=1;
    int k=0;
    while(1)
    {
        k=i*60;
        if(k<=m)
        {
            i++;
        }
        else
        {
            k=k-60;
            k=m-k;
            i--;
            break;
        }
    }
    h+=i;
    printf("%d %d",h,k);
}
