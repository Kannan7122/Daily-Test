Program :


In a super market, there is a list consisting of N products which are numbered from 0 to N - 1. The
names of the products are passed as the input to the program. The super market has
advertisements to attract customers. The program also accepts a list of integers representing the
product number which is advertised as the input. The program must print the product name having
the maximum number of advertisements as the output. If more than one product is having the
maximum number of advertisements then the program must print the first occurring product as
the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
2 <= Length of each product name <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines each contain a string representing a product name.
The (N+2)nd
line contains a list of integers representing the product numbers being advertised
separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the product name having the maximum number of advertisements.
