Program :


The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must alternatively multiply and
add the integers from 1 to N and then the program must print the obtained result as the output.  
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 30
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified value.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
Output:
25
Explanation:
The integers from 1 to 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The first two integers are 1 and 2 and their product is 2 (1*2) and then the product is added with
the next integer 3. So the result is 5 (2+3).
And then the result is multiplied by the next integer 4. So the product is 20 (5*4) and then the
product is added with the next integer 5. So the result is  25 (20+5).
Hence the output is 25
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
20
Output:
12252937700



Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    long long int n;
    scanf("%lld",&n);
    long long int res=0;
    int arr[n];
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        arr[i-1]=i;
    }
    int cnt=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(cnt==0)
        {
            res+=arr[i];
            cnt++;
        }
        else
        {
            cnt=0;
            res*=arr[i];
        }
    }
    printf("%lld",res);
}
