Program :


The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the integer which is
having the maximum number of factors among the N integers as the output. If more than one
integer is having the same maximum number of factors then the program must print the largest
integer among those integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^4
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integer based on the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 45 8 121 100
Output:
100
Explanation:
The factors of 10 are 1 2 5 and 10, the factors count is 4.
The factors of 45 are 1 3 5 9 15 and 45, the factors count is 6.
The factors of 8 are 1 2 4 and 8, the factors count is 4.
The factors of 121 are 1 11 and 121, the factors count is 3.
The factors of 100 are 1 2 4 5 10 20 25 50 and 100, the factors count is 9.
So 100 has the maximum number of factors.
Hence the output is 100
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
13 7 29 2
Output:
29




Code :


#Your code below
n=int(input())
nums=list(map(int,input().split()))
m=max((sum(1 for j in range(1,i+1) if i%j==0) for i in nums))
res=max((i for i in nums if sum(1 for j in range(1,i+1) if i%j==0)==m))
print(res)
