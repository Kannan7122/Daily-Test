Program :


The program must accept N integers and an integer K as the input. The program must print the
absolute difference between the number of integers greater than or equal to K and the number of
integers less than K as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, K <= 10^3
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^3
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains K.
Output Format:
The first line contains the absolute difference.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
20 30 50 44 10
35
Output:
1
Explanation:
There are two integers (44 and 50) which are greater than or equal to 35.
There are three integers (20 30 and 10) which are less than 35.
Here the absolute difference is |2 - 3| = 1.
Hence the output is 1
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10
3 7 9 4 1 13 6 2 5 8
3
Output:
6




Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr=new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
		    arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
		}
		int k=sc.nextInt();
		int c1=0,c2=0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
		    if(arr[i]>=k) {
		        c1++;
		    }
		    else {
		        c2++;
		    }
		} 
		System.out.println(Math.abs(c1-c2));
		
	}
}
