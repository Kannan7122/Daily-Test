Program :


The program must accept N integers as the input where N is even. The program must print the
sum of the 1st and Nth
integer, 2nd and (N-1)th
integer, 3rd and (N-2)th integer and so on.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of the 1st and Nth
integer, 2nd and (N-1)th
integer, 3rd and (N2)th
 integer and so on.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10
1 3 5 6 10 2 4 5 90 100
Output:
101 93 10 10 12
Explanation:
The 1st and 10th
integers are 1 and 100 and their sum value is 101. So 101 is printed.
The 2nd and 9th
integers are 3 and 90 and their sum value is 93. So 93 is printed.
The 3rd and 8th
integers are 5 and 5 and their sum value is 10. So 10 is printed.
The 4th and 7th
integers are 6 and 4 and their sum value is 10. So 10 is printed.
The 5th and 6th
integers are 10 and 2 and their sum value is 12. So 12 is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
5 20 15 25 10 45
Output:
50 30 40




Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int arr[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d ",&arr[i]);
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n/2;i++)
    {
        printf("%d ",arr[i]+arr[n-i-1]);
    }
}
