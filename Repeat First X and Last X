Program :


The program must accept a string S and an integer X as the input. The program must form a new
string by concatenating the first X and the last X characters of S alternatively. The length of the
new string must be equal to the length of S. Finally, the program must print the new string as the
output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= X <= Length of S
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
The second line contains the value of X.
Output Format:
The first line contains the new string which is formed as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
strawberry
3
Output:
strrrystrr
Explanation:
The first 3 characters in the string strawberry are s, t and r.
The last 3 characters in the string strawberry are r, r and y.
So the new string is formed by concatenating str and rry alternatively.
Here the length of the string strawberry is 10. Hence the output is strrrystrr
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
book
2
Output:
book



Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=sc.next();
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		int n=str.length();
		String s1=str.substring(0,x);
		String s2=str.substring(n-x,n);
		String ss="";
		ss+=s1;
		ss+=s2;
		int l=ss.length();
		int g=0;
		while(n!=0)
		{
		    System.out.print(ss.charAt(g));
		    g++;
		    if(g==l)
		    {
		        g=0;
		    }
		    n--;
		}
	}
}
