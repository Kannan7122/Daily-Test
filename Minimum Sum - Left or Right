Program :


The program must accept a list of unique positive integers and a positive integer X as the input.
The program must find the sum of integers left to integer X then the program must find the sum of
integers right to integer X. The program must print the minimum sum value among the obtained
two sum values as the output. If there is no integer before or after integer X, the program must print
0 as the minimum sum value.
Note: The integer X is always present in the given list of integers.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains the list of integers separated by space(s).
The second line contains the positive integer X.
Output Format:
The first line contains the minimum sum value based on the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
5
Output:
10
Explanation:
The integers left to integer 5 are 1 2 3 and 4. So their sum is 10.
The integers right to integer 5 are 6 7 8 and 9. So their sum is 30.
Here the minimum sum is 10.
So 10 is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
9 1 2 8 7 3
7
Output:
3






Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int arr[100000];
    int n,g=0;
    while(scanf("%d ",&n)!=EOF) {
        arr[g]=n;
        g++;
    }
    int x=arr[g-1];
    g--;
    int s1=0,s2=0,cnt=0;
    for(int i=0;i<g;i++) {
        if(arr[i]==x) {
            cnt++;
            continue;
        }
        if(cnt==0) {
            s1+=arr[i];
        }
        else {
            s2+=arr[i];
        }
    }
    if(s1<s2) {
        printf("%d",s1);
    }
    else {
        printf("%d",s2);
    }
}
