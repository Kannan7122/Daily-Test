The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC as the input. The program must print YES if
the elements in the first row are equal to the elements in the last row in their positions and the
elements in the second row are equal to the elements in the last but second row in their positions and
so on. Else the program must print NO as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines contain C integers each separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains either YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 4
20 25 40 55
45 50 65 60
45 50 65 60
20 25 40 55
Output:
YES
Explanation:
The elements in the first row are 20 30 40 and 50.
The elements in the fourth row are 20 30 40 and 50.
Here the elements in the first row are equal to the elements in the fourth row.
The elements in the second row are 45 50 65 and 60.
The elements in the third row are 45 50 65 and 60.
Here the elements in the second row are equal to the elements in the third row.
Hence the output is YES




Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int r,c;
    scanf("%d %d",&r,&c);
    int arr[r][c];
    for(int i=0;i<r;i++)
    {
        for(int j=0;j<c;j++)
        {
            scanf("%d ",&arr[i][j]);
        }
    }
    int count=0;
    for(int i=0;i<r/2;i++)
    {
        int cnt=0;
        for(int j=0;j<c;j++)
        {
            
            if(arr[i][j]==arr[r-i-1][j])
            {
                cnt++;    
            }
        }
        if(cnt==c)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if(count==r/2)
    {
        printf("YES");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("NO");
    }
}
