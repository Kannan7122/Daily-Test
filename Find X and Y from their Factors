Program :


The program must accept a list of integers containing all the divisors of X and all the divisors of Y (X
and Y are two positive integers where X >= Y). The program must find the integers X and Y from the
given list of divisors and print them as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^4
Input Format:
The first line contains a list of integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains X and Y separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 2 8 1 2 4 1 20 4 5
Output:
20 8
Explanation:
The factors of 20 are 1 2 4 5 10 and 20.
The factors of 8 are 1 2 4 and 8. So, all the factors of 20 and 8 have occurred in the given list of
integers.
Hence the output is 20 8
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1 2 3 6 1 2 3 6
Output:
6 6






Code :

#Your code below
n = list(map(int,input().split()))
s = max(n)
for i in range(1,s+1):
    if s%i==0:
        n.remove(i)
print(s,max(n))
