Program :

Choose the Balls
There are X yellow balls, Y blue balls and Z red balls in a box. Mr. ABC wants to choose A yellow balls,
B blue balls and C red balls based on the following conditions.
- B is always greater by exactly 1 than A.
- C is always greater by exactly 1 than B.
The values of X, Y and Z are passed as the input. The program must print the maximum number of
balls that he can get from the box as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= X, Y, Z <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the maximum number of balls that he can get from the box based on the given
conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
8 14 9
Output:
24
Explanation:
If Mr. ABC chooses 7 yellow balls, 8 blue balls and 9 red balls from the box then he will get the
maximum number of balls 24 as per the given conditions.
Hence the output is 24
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
13 4 6
Output:
12




Code :

import sys
x, y, z = map(int,input().split())
cnt = 0
if x==y and y==z:
    print((x-2)+(x-1)+(x))
    sys.exit()
if x==y and z>x:
    print((x-1)+(x)+(x+1))
    sys.exit()
elif x==z and y>x:
    print((x-2)+(x-1)+(x))
    sys.exit()
for i in range(1,10000):
    if i<=x and i<=y and i<=z:
        cnt+=1
    else:
        break
if cnt==x:
    if cnt+1 == z:
        print((cnt-1)+(cnt)+(cnt+1))
    else:
        print((cnt)+(cnt+1)+(cnt+2))
elif cnt==y:
    print((cnt-1)+(cnt)+(cnt+1))
elif cnt==z:
    print((cnt-2)+(cnt-1)+(cnt))
