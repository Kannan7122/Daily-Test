Program :


A boy wants to invite his N friends to his birthday party. So he decides to make N invitations. For
each invitation, he needs two blue sheets and five orange sheets. A nearby store sells an infinite
number of notebooks of any color, but each notebook consists of only one color with K sheets (i.e.,
Each notebook contains K sheets of the same color). The values of N and K are passed as the
input to the program. The program must print the number of notebooks that the boy needs to buy
to invite his N friends as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, K <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the number of notebooks based on the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 5
Output:
5
Explanation:
To invite 3 friends, he needs 6 blue sheets (3 x 2) and 10 orange sheets (3 x 5).
So he buys 2 notebooks containing only blue sheets (2x5 = 10 blue sheets) and 3 notebooks
containing only orange sheets (3x5 = 15 orange sheets).
Totally, he buys 5 notebooks to invite his friends.
Hence the output is 5
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
15 6
Output:
18






Code :


#Your code below
n,k=map(int,input().split())
print((((n*2)+k-1)//k)+(((n*5)+k-1)//k))
