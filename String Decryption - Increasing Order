Program :


The program must accept a string S (encrypted string) containing only alphabets as the input. The
encryption algorithm is given below.
- The first character occurs only once.
- The second character occurs twice.
- The third character occurs thrice and so on.
The program must decrypt the string S and print it as the output.
Note: The string S is always a valid encrypted string.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the decrypted string of S.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
baabbb
Output:
bab
Explanation:
baabbb can be decrypted as bab. So bab is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
ooopppssss
Output:
oops







Code :


import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=sc.next();
		int g=1;
		for(int i=0;i<str.length();i+=g) {
		    System.out.print(str.charAt(i));
		    g++;
		}
	}
}
