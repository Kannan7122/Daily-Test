Program :


There is a sequence of integers containing the integers from X to Y. The program must
accept N integers from the sequence (where X and Y are always present) as the input. The
program must print the number of missing integers in the sequence as the output.
Note: N is always less than or equal to total number of integers from X to Y.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the number of missing integers.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
4 5 6 10 11
Output:
3
Explanation:
Here the sequence of integers containing the integers from 4 to 11 is 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
So there are three missing integers 7, 8 and 9.
Hence the output is 3
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
10 13 12 8
Output:
2
Explanation:
Here the sequence of integers containing the integers from 8 to 13 is 8 9 10 11 12 13.
So there are two missing integers 9 and 11.
Hence the output is 2
Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
5
7 5 6 4 8
Output:
0





Code :

#Your code below
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
a=min(l)
s=max(l)
print(s-(a+n-1))
