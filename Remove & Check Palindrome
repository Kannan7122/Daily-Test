The program must accept a string S containing only lower case alphabets as the input. The
program must print YES if the string S is a palindrome after removing any one alphabet from it.
Else the program must print NO as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abkcddcba
Output:
YES
Explanation:
After removing the alphabet k from abkcddcba, the string becomes abcddcba which is a
palindrome.
Hence the output is YES
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
madam
Output:
YES
Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
abcdfdeba
Output:
NO






Code :

#Your code below
def pr(s):
    def p(s):
        return s==s[::-1]
        
    for i in range(len(s)):
        m=s[:i]+s[i+1:]
        if p(m):
            return "YES"
    
    return "NO"
s=input()
result = pr(s)
print(result)
