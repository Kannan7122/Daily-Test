Program :


The program must accept N integers and an integer X as the input. The program must print the
sum of 2^X integers from the Xth
integer as the output. If there is no 2^X integers from the
X
th
integer then print the sum of all integers from the Xth
integer as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 1000
1 <= X <= 9
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains X.
Output Format:
The first line contains the sum based on the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
2 1 4 3 5
2
Output:
13
Explanation:
Here X = 2, so 2^2 = 4.
The 2nd
 integer is 1, so the 4 integers from 1 are 1 4 3 5 and their sum is 13.
Hence the output is 13
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
5 4 7 3 9 1
3
Output:
20





Code :

num = int(input())
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
x=int(input())
sum_val = 0
count = 2**x
i = x-1
j = 1
while i < num and j <= count:
    sum_val += arr[i]
    i += 1
    j += 1
print(sum_val)
