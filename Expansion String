Program :


The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the string from the
1
st character, then the program must print the string from the 2nd character, then the program must
print the string from the 3rd character and so on.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the string value as per the above description.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
orange
Output:
orangerangeangengegee
Explanation:
In the string orange, the first character is o. So orange is printed.
In the string orange, the second character is r. So print the string starting from the second
character. Hence, range is printed.
In the string orange, the third character is a. So print the string starting from the third character.
Hence, ange is printed.
In the string orange, the fourth character is n. So print the string starting from the fourth character.
Hence, nge is printed.
In the string orange, the fifth character is g. So print the string starting from the fifth character.
Hence, ge is printed.
In the string orange, the sixth character is e. So the last character is e. Hence, e is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
ant
Output:
antntt





Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char ch[100];
    scanf("%s",ch);
    int n=strlen(ch);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        for(int j=i;j<n;j++) {
            printf("%c",ch[j]);
        }
    }
}
