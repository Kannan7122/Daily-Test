Program :



The program must accept an integer N and a series of integers as the input. The program must
remove all occurrences of N and print the count of remaining integers in the series as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <=  Each integer value <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The next line contains the series of integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of integers as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2
1 2 3 5 2
Output:
3
Explanation:
Here N = 2. So after removing all the occurrences of 2, the series becomes 1 3 5.
Now the series contains only 3 integers. Hence 3 is printed as the output. 
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
1 3 2 3 4 3 5
Output:
4




Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int x,n;
    int arr[100];
    scanf("%d\n",&x);
    int g=0;
    while(scanf("%d ",&n)!=EOF) {
        arr[g]=n;
        g++;
    }
    int cnt=0;
    for(int i=0;i<g;i++) {
        if(arr[i]!=x) {
            cnt++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d",cnt);
}
