Program :


The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must find the number of
ones T in the binary representation of N. Then the program must form the binary representation of
an integer X by concatenating T ones. Finally, the program must print the integer value of X as the
output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains X.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10
Output:
3
Explanation:
There are 2 ones present in the binary representation of 10 (1010). 
So the binary representation of the integer X is 11.
The decimal equivalent of 11 is 3.
Hence the output is 3
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
15
Output:
15



Code :

#Your code below
n = int(input())
b = bin(n) [2:].replace('0','')
print(int(b,2))
