Program :


The program must accept N integers separated by an alphabet as the input. The program must
print the sum of those N integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^7
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by an alphabet.
Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of N integers.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
10a5w240n23
Output:
278
Explanation:
The four integers are 10, 5, 240 and 23. So their sum is 278.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
1s2d3h4e4
Output:
14





Code :


n = int(input())
s = input().strip()
d = ""
res = 0
for i in s:
    if i.isnumeric():
        d+=i
    else:
        res+=int(d)
        d=""
res+=int(d)
print(res)
