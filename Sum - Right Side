Program :


The program must accept N integers as the input. For each integer X among the N integers, the
program must print the sum of all the integers which are less than X and right to X as the output. If
there is no such integer on the right side of X then the program must print 0 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains N integers separated by a space as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
3 5 2 4 1
Output:
3 7 1 1 0
Explanation:
For the 1st
 integer, there are two values 2 and 1 which are less than 3 on its right. So their sum
is 3 which is printed as the output.
For the 2nd
 integer, there are three values 2 4 and 1 which are less than 5 on its right. So their sum
is 7 which is printed as the output.
For the 3rd
integer, there is only one value 1 which is less than 2 on its right. Here 1 is printed as
the output.
For the 4th
 integer, there is only one value 1 which is less than 4 on its right. Here 1 is printed as
the output.
For the 5th
 integer, there is no integer on its right. So 0 is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
2 8 1 5 4 2 9 3
Output:
1 15 0 9 5 0 3 0



Code :

n = int(input())
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
for i in range(n-1):
    s = 0
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        if arr[j] < arr[i] :
            s += arr[j]
    print(s, end=" ")
print("0")
