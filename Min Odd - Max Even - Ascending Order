The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must find the smallest odd integer
among the N integers as X. Then the program must find the largest even integer among the N
integers as Y. Finally, the program must print all the integers between X and Y (inclusive of X and Y) in
ascending order as the output.
Note: At least one integer is always odd and at least one integer is always even.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^7
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integers based on the given conditions separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
5 8 3 2 10
Output:
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Explanation:
The odd integers are 5 and 3. Here the minimum odd integer is 3.
The even integers are 8, 2 and 10. Here the maximum even integer is 10.
So the integers from 3 to 10 are printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
15 2 8 6 21 91
Output:
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
