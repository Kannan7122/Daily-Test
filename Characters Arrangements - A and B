The program must accept a string S (containing only A and B) and an integer K as the input. The
program must print yes if the characters can be arranged in the string such that there are at least K
number of B present between every two A.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000
1 <= K <= Length of S
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains K.
Output Format:
The first line contains yes or no.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
ABABBABBBB
3
Output:
yes
Explanation:
The string ABABBABBBB can be arranged as ABBBABBBBA.
Here there are at least three B present between all every A characters.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
ABBA
3
Output:
no





Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char ch[1000];
    scanf("%s",ch);
    int n=strlen(ch);
    int x;
    scanf("%d",&x);
    int cnt1=0,cnt2=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(ch[i]=='A')
        {
            cnt1++;
        }
        else
        {
            cnt2++;
        }
    }
    if(2*cnt1<=cnt2)
    {
        printf("yes");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("no");
    }
}
