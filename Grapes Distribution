Program :


In a box, there are A green grapes, B purple grapes and C black grapes. There are three boys B1, B2
and B3 who are all grape lovers. The boys B1, B2 and B3 should eat at least X, Y and Z grapes
respectively with the following conditions.
- B1 eats only green grapes.
- B2 never eats black grapes.
- B3 eats any kind of grapes.
The values of X, Y, Z, A, B and C are passed as input to the program. The program must print YES if
it is possible to distribute the grapes so that everyone gets their respective number of grapes (at
least X, Y and Z). Else the program must print NO as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y, Z, A, B, C <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space.
The second line contains A, B and C separated by a space
Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1 6 2 
4 3 3
Output:
YES
Explanation:
Initially, the box contains G:4 P:3 B:3
B1 gets 1 grape from the 4 green grapes (as he eats only green grapes).
Now the box contains G:3 P:3 B:3
B2 gets 6 grapes from the 3 green grapes and the 3 purple grapes (as he never eats black grapes).
Now the box contains G:0 P:0 B:3
B3 gets 2 grapes from the 3 black grapes (as he eats any kind of grapes).
Now the box contains G:0 P:0 B:1
Here the grapes in the box are distributed among the three boys as per the given conditions.
Hence the output is YES
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 1 1
4 3 2
Output:
NO






Code :

#Your code below
import sys
b1, b2, b3 = map(int, input().split())
g, p, b = map(int, input().split())

if b1<=g :
    g = g-b1
else:
    print("NO")
    sys.exit()

x = g+p
if b2<=x :
    x = x-b2
else:
    print("NO")
    sys.exit()

y = x+b
if b3<=y:
    y = y-b3
    print("YES");
else:
    print("NO")
