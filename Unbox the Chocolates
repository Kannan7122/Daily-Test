Program :

 A girl has N boxes of chocolates. The number of chocolates in each box is passed as input. She wants
to eat K chocolates from the N boxes based on the following conditions.
- She must open the boxes in the given order.
- She can't open more than one box in a day.
- Every day she can eat at most 8 chocolates. (If a box contains more than 8 chocolates, she can eat
the remaining chocolates later)
The value of K is also passed as the input to the program. The program must print the minimum
number of days she has to eat exactly K chocolates as the output.
Note: The value of K is always less than or equal to the total number of chocolates in the N boxes.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= K, Each integer value <=1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the minimum number of days she has to eat exactly K chocolates.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 18
10 10 10
Output:
3
Explanation:
On the first day, she can eat 8 chocolates from the first box (2 chocolates are remaining in the first
box).
On the second day, she can eat 2 chocolates from the first box and 6 chocolates from the second box
(4 chocolates are remaining in the second box).
On the third day, she can eat 2 chocolates from the second box. The third box is not opened as she
can get 18 chocolates from the first 2 boxes.
So it takes 3 days to eat 18 chocolates.
Hence the output is 3






Code :

n,m = map(int,input().split())
l = list(map(int,input().split()))
s=0;t=0;i=0
while(s<m):
    p=l[t]
    k=min(l[t],8)
    s+=k
    if(t==n-1):
        t=0
        l[t]+=(p-k)
    else:
        t+=1
        l[t]+=(p-k)
    i+=1
print(i)
