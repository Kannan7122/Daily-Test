The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the odd integers which are
present at the odd positions in the given N integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^3
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the list of odd integer(s) separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
10 13 15 12 31 33
Output:
15 31
Explanation:
The odd Integers are 13, 15, 31 and 33. But only 15 and 31 are at odd positions which are printed as
the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
21 20 27
Output:
21 27







Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr=new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
		    arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
		    if(arr[i]%2!=0 && i%2==0)
		    {
		        System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
		    }
		}
