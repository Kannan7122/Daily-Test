Program :



The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the maximum number of
consonants between the alternate vowels in S as the output.
Note: The string S always contains atleast two vowels.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= Length of S <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the maximum number of consonants between the alternate vowels.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrackCODINGPLATFORM
Output:
4
Explanation:
The number of consonants between the vowels 'i' and 'a' in the string
skillrackCODINGPLATFORM is 3.
The number of consonants between the vowels 'a' and 'O' in the string
skillrackCODINGPLATFORM is 3.
The number of consonants between the vowels 'O' and 'I' in the string
skillrackCODINGPLATFORM is 1.
The number of consonants between the vowels 'I' and 'A' in the string
skillrackCODINGPLATFORM is 4.
The number of consonants between the vowels 'A' and 'O' in the string
skillrackCODINGPLATFORM is 2.
Here the maximum number of consonants is 4.
Hence the output is 4
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
aaao
Output:
0





Code :

#Your code below
s=input().strip()
vow="aeiouAEIOU"
n1=[v for v in range(len(s)) if s[v] in vow]
c=[(abs(n1[v]-n1[v+1])-1) for v in range(len(n1)-1)]
print(max(c))
