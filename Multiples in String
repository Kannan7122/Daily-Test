Program :


The program must accept a string value S and an integer N as the input. The program must print
the output based on the following conditions.
-If the length of the string S is divisible by N, then the program must print the characters
present at the positions of multiples of N in the string S as the output.
-If the length of the string S is not divisible by N, then the program must print the characters which
are not present at the positions of multiples of N in the string S as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= N <= Length of S
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
The second line contains the integer N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the string based on the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
Encyclopedia
3
Output:
clea
Explanation:
The length of Encyclopedia is 12.
The length 12 is a divisible integer of 3.
Hence the multiples of 3  position are c, l, e, and a.
Hence the output is clea
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
wikipedia
2
Output:
wkpda



Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=sc.next();
		int n=str.length();
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
		    if(n%x==0)
		    {
		        if(i!=0)
		        {
		            if((i+1)%x==0)
		            {
		                System.out.print(str.charAt(i));
		            }
		        }
		    }
		    else
		    {
		        if((i+1)%x!=0)
		        {
		            System.out.print(str.charAt(i));
		        }
		    }
		}

	}
}
