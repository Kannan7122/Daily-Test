Program :


The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must replace each integer with the
product of remaining integers among the N integers. Finally, the program must print the modified
value of the N integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 15
0 <= Each integer value <= 10
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the N integers separated by a space as per the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
1 3 5 7 9
Output:
945 315 189 135 105
Explanation:
The first integer is replaced with 3*5*7*9 = 945
The second integer is replaced with 1*5*7*9 = 315
The third integer is replaced with 1*3*7*9 = 189
The fourth integer is replaced with 1*3*5*9 = 135
The fifth integer is replaced with 1*3*5*7 = 105
Hence the output is
945 315 189 135 105
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2
7 0
Outp




Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int arr[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        scanf("%d ",&arr[i]);
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        int res=1;
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++) {
            if(i==j) {
                continue;
            }
            else {
                res*=arr[j];
            }
        }
        printf("%d ",res);
    }
}
