Program :


The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must form an integer K using N
integers based on the following condition. The binary representation of the integer K must be formed
by using the second bit from the end (last but one bit) of every integer among the N integers in the
given order. Finally the program must print the integer K as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 15
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N Integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains value of K.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3
10 9 4
Output:
4
Explanation:
The second bit of 10 from the end is 1.
The second bit of 9 from the end is 0.
The second bit of 4 from the end is 0.
The binary value formed is 100 whose decimal value is 4. Hence 4 is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
4
1 9 7 2
Output:
3




Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int arr[]=new int[n];
		String s="";
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
		    arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
		    int x=arr[i];
		    String bin=Integer.toBinaryString(x);
		    int l=bin.length();
		    if(l==1) {
		        s+='0';
		        continue;
		    }
		    s+=bin.charAt(l-2);
		}
		System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(s,2));
	}
}
